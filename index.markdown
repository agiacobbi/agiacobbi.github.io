title: About Me

Hi! I'm Alex Giacobbi and I develop software at Expedia Group. I recently graduated from 
Gonzaga University with a degree in Computer Science. Now, I live and work in Seattle, WA.

At Expedia Group, I am helping to pilot a new graduate program. As part of this program, new
graduates (me) will complete two six-month rotations with two different teams before being
placed in a permanent team. I recently finished my first rotation in the InsurTech 
division here at EG. In this team, I became very familiar our travel insurance business. 
Over the last seven months, I learned about our architecture by working on our internal services
and our about business goals by cooperating with our product team and external partners to deliver on
various objectives. There is a great culture at Expedia that encourages us to collaborate with 
and learn from the many talented developers at our company. My next rotation takes me to the 
Order/Trip Services division. I am excited to begin this new learning opportunity.

Outside of work, I have been enjoying my new home in Seattle. Growing up in Arizona
has taught me to appreciate the seasons and occasional rain. In my free time,
you will usually find me doing something active and outdoors. I love hiking, skiing and playing 
all sorts of sports -- basketball, soccer, tennis, golf -- you name it. I also love to travel,
and enjoy spending time plotting my next trip.

You can find my updated resume [here](./assets/Resume.pdf).
