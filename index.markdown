title: About Me
---

My name is Alex Giacobbi and I am a Computer Science major at Gonzaga University.
On campus, I work as a research assistant and a teaching assistant. My research is in 
processing and feature extraction from child-directed speech data. Read more about this
in the Projects section. As a teaching assistant, I interact with students during
offce hours and break down confusing topics. I also develop test programs to grade assignments.
Outside of the classroom, you can probably find me outside playing sports, tutoring fellow students,
or at a piano teaching myself a new song. 

For a quick summary, you can find my resume [here](/assets/Resume.pdf).
